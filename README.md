# FizzBuzz - Strategy Pattern

This repo showing how to solve the FizzBuzz problem using the Strategy Pattern.

## What is FizzBuzz?

FizzBuzz is a very common interview question, where you have to print the numbers from 1 to 100, but:

- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
- If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
- If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
- Otherwise, print the number

## Why Strategy Pattern?

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, put them into separate classes, and make their objects interchangeable.

This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## How to run?

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
